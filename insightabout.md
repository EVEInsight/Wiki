# About
Insight originally started as a Discord bot project in Fall 2017 as a learning experience in Python asynchronous programming. The first Insight iteration was completed in March 2018. Insight was rewritten completely during Summer 2018 and released in August of 2018. Since then I have maintained the project and slowly added new features. 2019 was a busy year, but I still maintain Insight and have plans for new features. I see Insight as feature-complete, but there are things can be improved that will be done in time.

# About Me
In EVE, I am [Natuli](https://evewho.com/character/1326083433) and I have played EVE since 2010. I started working on EVE API projects here and there over the years and Insight gained a bit of popularity in 2018. I stopped playing EVE in 2018, but I still enjoy writing EVE projects. Maintaing Insight and other new EVE projects are my way of winning the game and I don't plan on going anywhere anytime soon!
