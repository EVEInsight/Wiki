# Introduction
Insight is a Discord bot that provides feed services to Discord channels. All feed setup and programming is done through Discord commands. Insight has no form of overarching global configuration so every feed/channel is independent from other feeds. It is suitable and recommended to run a single Insight service across multiple Discord servers due to the independent and isolated configuration of channels.

# Getting Insight
There are two options to run Insight: [**self-host**](/install) or use the [**public Insight bot**](https://invite.eveinsight.net) provided and hosted by the developer.
