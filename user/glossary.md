# Definitions and terms for Insight
These are terms referenced by the Insight wiki and software. This section provivides an overview of these terms and their meaning. 
- **Feed:** A service category provided by Insight that is linked to a Discord channel that prvides some form of killmail streaming. Feeds are unique per channel and can only be custimized within the scope of a Discord channel. Feeds are independent from the configuration of other channels, Discord servers, and Insight's ```config.ini``` server config file.
- **Entity:** A pilot, corporation, alliance, or NPC pilot/ship type within EVE Online.
- **Entity feed:** A type of feed that streams kills based on a tracked entity or value threshold. Examples: A corporation killboard stream or feed that tracks global super losses.
- **Radar feed:** A type of feed that tracks capital or specific ship types within a set light-year range of a set of EVE Online systems. The key point of a radar feed is tracking ships within a light-year range of select systems. Specific ships must be whitelisted to be tracked. A radar feed only tracks the ships you specify during configuration. Optional to blacklist ally only mails from posting.
- **Proximity feed:** A type of feed similar to a radar feed that tracks based on gate distances instead of light-year distance. Proximity feeds can be configured to track ships within so many jumps of a target system, an entire constellation, or an entire region. All ships are tracked by default in contrast to radar feeds. Optional to blacklist ally only mails from posting.
- **Feed appearance:** A template that changes the way killmails are presented in a Discord channel. Each feed type has multiple appearances ranging from large (with more data) to small (concise data). Appearances can be changed at any time.
- **Command:** A text or phrase entered in a Discord chat by a user that causes Insight to do something. See [command overview](/user/commands).
