# Getting Started
This wiki is a work in progress and will eventually replace the GitHub wiki.

# What is Insight?
Insight provides EVE Online killmail streaming for Discord. Insight can stream personal or corporate killboards, detect supercapitals with a proximity radar, and more! Insight is a Discord bot that can be directly invited to your server to provide your community with killmail streaming and intel in an easy-to-use package.

Insight is completely free and open-source and all code is available on [GitHub](https://git.eveinsight.net).

# How do I quickly get started with Insight?
If you are a Discord server administrator, simply visit the [Insight bot Discord invite](https://invite.eveinsight.net) and check out the [user guide](/user/intro). Run ```!help``` if you are stuck.

# How do I host Insight myself?
The easiest way to host Insight yourself is through [Docker](/install/docker). Check out the [install guide](/install) for setting up Insight for self-hosting.

# I need more help or want to offer suggestions.
See [Insight support](/insightsupport).
